# TvMaze
This repository aims to help Android Devs with the integration of MVVM design pattern using Android Architecture Components.
It tries to give a solid implementation of `LiveData` and `ViewModel` and how those complex concepts can be integrated using Dagger 2 with dagger Android support. That said, no need to create `Subcomponent` to inject `Activity` or `Fragment`. 

The codebase tries to follow Uncle Bob Clean Code Architechture with SOLID principles.

The aim of this app is to replicate the high level functionality of www.tvmaze.com and showcase an android app out of it. The TvMaze shows the tv shows which are scheduled to air on the current day starting at prime time.

It also has Static Code Analysis tools integrated. Want to know more. Read my article on medium:
