# TvMaze
The Android application showcasing the use of MVP architechture with RxJava2, Retrofit2, Dagger2, DataBinding and Glide

The codebase tries to follow Uncle Bob Clean Code Architechture with MVP pattern at its base. 

The aim of this app is to replicate the high level functionality of www.tvmaze.com and showcase an android app out of it. The TvMaze shows the tv shows which are scheduled to air on the current day starting at prime time.

Currently the home screen has been implemented and the work is in progress for a tv show detail screen using Kotlin. If you are eager to know more, you can dive into the branch `show_detail_kotlin` and get the latest updates.

It also has Static Code Analysis tools integrated. Want to know more. Read my article on medium
